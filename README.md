Efficient Linear Regression Analysis for California Housing Market Prediction

# California Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in California using a simple yet efficient linear regression model. The California Housing dataset, available in the scikit-learn library, is used for this purpose.

## Dataset
The dataset contains metrics such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude. More details can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html).

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- **Standardization**: [Explain if you used any standardization or why you chose not to]

### Model Implementation
- **Linear Regression**: The `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model` was employed.
- **Training**: The model was trained on the training set.

### Model Evaluation
- **Testing**: The model's performance was evaluated using the test set.
- **Metrics**: R2_Score and MSE were used as evaluation metrics.

## Results
- **R2 Score**: [Insert R2 Score here]
- **Mean Squared Error**: [Insert MSE here]

### Inferences
[Discuss any interesting findings, the model's performance, any potential biases, limitations, and areas for future work]

## How to Run
Provide instructions on how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the code.

## Conclusion
[Provide a brief conclusion of the project]
